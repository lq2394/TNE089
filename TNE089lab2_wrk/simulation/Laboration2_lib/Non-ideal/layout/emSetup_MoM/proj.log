--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

S-parameter results show unphysical behavior for certain frequencies.
Cause        : - inaccurate (high frequency) calibration ;
               - electrically large via using lumped model ;
               - higher order modes at the ports ;
               - slot mode at coplanar ports ;
               - grouped strip-slot ports ;
               - mesh density is too coarse.
